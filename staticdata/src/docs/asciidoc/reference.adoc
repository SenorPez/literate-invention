[[overview-hypermedia]]
=== Hypermedia

The {apiname} conforms to the http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[Hypertext Application Language (HAL)] standard.

* Resources are represented by key-value pairs.
* Collections of resources are contained in an `_embedded` field. Fields of embedded resources may be transformed or
omitted.
* Links to other resources are contained in a `_links` field.
** Users should not create URIs but use the `_links` field entries to navigate the API.
** Some resources may be represented by multiple `_links` values depending on the position in the API hierarchy. With
the exception of the `_links` field, these resources are identical regardless of the link used to reach them.

The following fields are present in the `_links` value of every resource.
